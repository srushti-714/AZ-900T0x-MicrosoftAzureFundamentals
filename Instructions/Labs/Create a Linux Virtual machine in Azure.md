# Lab 01 - Create a virtual machine in the portal

## Lab overview

An Azure Virtual Machine (VM) is a computing resource provided by Microsoft Azure. It allows users to create and use virtualized computing instances in the cloud. Azure Virtual Machines enable users to run applications, host websites, and perform various computing tasks without needing to purchase and maintain physical hardware.

In this walkthrough, we will create a virtual machine in the Azure portal, connect to the virtual machine, install the web server role and test.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Create the virtual machine
+ Task 2: Connect to the virtual machine
+ Task 3: Host a Basic Website on your New Cloud VM

## Estimated timing: 30 minutes

**Note**: Take time during this walk-through to click and read the Informational icons.

### Task 1: Create the virtual machine

In this task, we will create a Windows Server 2019 Datacenter - Gen2 virtual machine. 

1. On Azure Portal page, in Search resources, services and docs (G+/) box at the top of the portal, enter **Virtual machines (1)**, and then select **Virtual machines (2)** under services.

   ![](../images/lab1-image1.png) 

1. On the **Virtual machines** blade, click **+ Create (1)** and choose **Azure virtual machine (2)**.

    ![](../images/lab1-image2.png) 

1. On the **Basics** tab, fill in the following information (leave the defaults for everything else):

    | Settings | Values |
    |  -- | -- |
    | Subscription | **Accept default subscription** (1)|
    | Resource group | **myRGVM-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** (2) |
    | Virtual machine name | **myVm** (3)|
    | Location | **(US) East US** (4)|
    | Image | **Windows Server 2019 Datacenter - Gen2** (5)|
    | Size | **Standard_D2s_v3** (6)|
    | Administrator account username | **azureuser** (7)|
    | Administrator account password | **Pa$$w0rd1234** (8)|
    | Inbound port rules  | **Allow select ports** (9)|
    | Select inbound ports | **RDP (3389)** and **HTTP (80)** (10)|
    |||

1. Click **Next** to switch to the **Disks** tab and in the **OS Disk type** select **Standard HDD** from the dropdown and leave everything else as default and click **Next**. 

   ![Screenshot of the virtual machine properties with the Connect button highlighted.](../images/hdd.png)

1. Within the Networking tab, look for the **Select inbound ports**:

    | Settings | Values |
    | -- | -- |
    | Select inbound ports | **HTTP (80), RDP (3389)**|
   
    >**Note:** - Verify that both port 80 and 3389 are selected

1. Click **Next** to switch to the **Management** tab and leave everything as default.

1. Click **Next** to switch to the **Monitoring** tab, select the following setting:

    | Settings | Values |
    | -- | -- |
    | Boot diagnostics | **Disable**|
  
1. Leave the remaining defaults and then click the **Review + Create** button at the bottom of the page.

1. Once Validation is passed click the **Create** button. It can take anywhere from five to seven minutes to deploy the virtual machine.

1. You will receive updates on the deployment page and via the **Notifications** area (the bell icon in the top menu).

### Task 2: Connect to the virtual machine

In this task, we will connect to our new virtual machine using RDP. 

1. Once the deployment is complete, click on **Go to resource** you will be directed to the page of the newly created Virtual Machine.

    ![Screenshot of the virtual machine properties with the Connect button highlighted.](../images/goto.png)
   
1. On the virtual machine **Overview** blade, click the **Connect** button and choose the **Connect** from the dropdown.

    ![Screenshot of the virtual machine properties with the Connect button highlighted.](../images/conrdp.png)

    >**Note:**: The following directions tell you how to connect to your VM from a Windows computer. On a Mac, you need an RDP client such as this Remote Desktop Client from the Mac App Store and on a Linux computer you can use an open source RDP client.

1. Within the **Connect** page, click on **Download RDP File**.

   ![Screenshot of the virtual machine properties with the Connect button highlighted. ](../images/downrdp.png)

1. Once the file is downloaded,you will be directed with a warning, click on **Keep**.

1. **Open** the downloaded RDP file and click **Connect** when prompted. 

    ![Screenshot of the virtual machine properties with the Connect button highlighted. ](../images/0102.png)

1. In the **Windows Security** window, select **More choices** and then **Use a different account**. Provide the username (.\azureuser) and the password (Pa$$w0rd1234). Click **OK** to connect.

    ![Screenshot of the Windows security dialogue with use a different account selected and the username azure user entered and a password.](../images/0103.png)

1. You may receive a certificate warning during the sign-in process. Click **Yes** or to create the connection and connect to your deployed VM. You should connect successfully.

### Task 3: Host a Basic Website on your New Azure Cloud VM

In this task, install the Web Server role on the server and host a basic website.

1. In the Server Manager (which should launch automatically) once you connect to the vm, select **Add roles and features** as shown below in the screenshot: 

    ![server manager](../images/az900-t3_s1.png)

    >**Note:** If you get a pop-up related to **Networking** click **No**
    
    ![server manager](../images/network.png)

1. Within the **Add Roles and Features Wizard** dialog box, click on **Next**.

1. Ensure **Role-based or feature-based installation** is selected. Click Next.

1. Ensure **Select a server from the server pool** is selected, and that your VM appears in the list below. Click on **Next**.

1. In the Server roles list, scroll to near bottom of the list and check **Web Server (IIS)**. Click on **Add Features**.

    ![server pool](../images/az900-t3_s5.png)

1. Click on **Next** until you reach the **Confirm installation selections** page and make sure **Restart the destination server automatically if required** is checked. Then click on **Install**.

    ![Restart the destination check box](../images/az900-t3_s7.png)

    >**Note:** If a pop-up appears warning about the automatic server restart, select **Yes**.

1. When the installation completes, click on**Close** and back on the server manager portal, go to **Tools** > **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**.

    ![](../images/az900-t3_s9.png)

1. In the Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager window, locate your serverâ€™s Default Web Site in the Connections tree.

    ![](../images/az900-t3_s10.png)

1. Now, click on **Basic Settings** in the **Actions** menu. In the new pop-up dialog box, locate the **Physical Path** and click **Ok**. This is where you'll put your website html file.

    ![](../images/az900-t3_s12.png)

   >**Note:** Keep a note of the path as it will be required in the preceding steps.

1. Open a notepad file to create a very basic html file. Save it as **Default.htm** and place it in the Physical Path location specified in the Basic Settings. For example:

    ```
    <html>
    <body>
        <h1>Demo Website</h1>
        <p>This is my first cloud hosted website.</p>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
    ![](../images/root.png)

1. Now back in the Azure portal, navigate back to the Overview blade of myVM and use the Copy to clipboard button to copy the public IP address of myVm.

    ![](../images/az900-t3_vm_pip.png)

1. Open a new browser tab, paste the public IP address into the URL text box, and press the Enter key to browse to it. The custom created basic website shows up.
