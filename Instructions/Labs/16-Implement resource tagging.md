# Lab 16 - Implement resource tagging

## Lab overview

In this walkthrough, we will create a policy assignment that requires tagging, created a storage account and test the tagging, view resources with a specified tag, and remove the tagging policy.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Create a Policy assignment
+ Task 2: Create a storage account to test the required tagging
+ Task 3: View all resources with a specific tag
+ Task 4: Delete the policy assignment

## Estimated timing: 30 minutes

### Task 1: Create a Policy assignment

In this task, we will configure the **Require a tag on resources** policy and assign it to our subscription. 

1. On the Azure portal, from the **Search resources, services, and docs** blade, search for and select **Policy**.

1. In **Authoring** section, click **Assignments**, and then click **Assign Policy** from the top of the page.

1. Notice the **Scope** for our policy will be subscription wide. 

1. Select the **Policy definition** ellipsis button (end of the textbox on the right). In **Available definition**, Search/Select **Require a tag and its value on resources** definition, then click **Add**.

1. On the **Assign policy** blade, click **Next** twice to switch to **Parameters** tab, type in **Company** (1) for the Tag name and **Contoso** (2) for the Tag Value. Click **Review + create** (3), and then subsequently click on **Create**.

    **Note:** This is a simple example to demonstrate tagging. Please note that the assignment takes around 30 minutes to take effect. 
 

1. The **Require a tag and its value on resources** policy assignment is now in place. When a resource is created, it must include a tag with the Company : Contoso key.

### Task 2: Create a storage account to test the required tagging

In this task, we will create storage accounts to test the required tagging. 

1. In the Azure Portal, from the **Search resources, services, and docs** blade, search for and select **Storage accounts**, and then click **+ Create**.

1. On the **Basics** tab of the **Create storage account** blade, fill in the following information. Leave the defaults for everything else.

    | Setting | Value | 
    | --- | --- |
    | Subscription | **Use your subscription** |
    | Resource group | **myRGTags**  |
    | Storage account name | **storageaccount<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** |
    | Location | **<inject key="Region" enableCopy="false"/>** |
    | | |


1. Click **Review**. 

    **Note:** We are testing to see what happens when the tag is not supplied. 

1. You will receive a Validation failed message. On the **Tags** tab note the error message stating that the resource was disallowed by Policy.

1. Provide the tagging information:- 

    | Setting | Value | 
    | --- | --- |
    | Name | **Company** (may not be in the drop-down list) |
    | Value| **Contoso** (may not be in the drop-down list) |
    | | |

1. Click **Review** and verify that the validation was successful. Click **Create** to deploy the storage account. 

### Task 3: View all resources with a specific tag

1. In the Azure Portal, from the **Search resources, services, and docs** blade, search for and select **Tags**.

1. Note all tags and their values. Click the **Company : Contoso** key/value pair. This will display a blade showing the newly created storage account, as long as you included the tag during its deployment.

1. Click **Add filter** and add the **Company** tag key as the filter category. With the filter applied, only your storage account will be listed.

### Task 4: Delete the policy assignment

In this task, we will remove the **Require a tag and its value on resources** policy so it does not affect our future work. 

1. In the portal, from the **Search resources, services, and docs** blade, search for and select **Policy**.

1. In the **Require a tag and its value on resources** policy entry scroll o the right and click on the elipsis button and selet**Delete Assignment**.

1. Confirm you wish to delete the policy assignment in the **Delete assignment** dialogue by clicking **Yes**

   In this walkthrough, we created a policy assignment that required tagging, created a storage account and tested the tagging, viewed resources with a specified tag, and removed the tagging policy.
